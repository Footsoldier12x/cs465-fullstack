# CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture

### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

The HTML site can be described as a poster. It has content but it is static, you may be able to write on it, but there is no change to the source of the poster or other posters of the same type. With the single-page application (SPA), you can have the same information displayed in many different places just as the HTML static page, but it becomes interactive and perhaps interconnected. Instead of a poster, you have an interactive touchscreen, in which you can access, change, update, or delete information tied to a database. This enables two-way communication between the user and server, instead of just one way communication from the server to the public.

### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

A NoSQL MongoDB database offers the flexibility of a schema-less database and the ability to be easily integrated with the use of JSON and JavaScript.

## Functionality

### How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JavaScript objects containing JSON data makes the transfer of data between the frontend and backend easier. JavaScript is also utilized throughout the whole stack, streamlining the development process.

### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Angular components make it easier to add functionality to a project due to its compartmentalized structured. For example, the addition of the crypto class assisted in the creation of a hash token to authenticate a user and authorize admin access for trip addition, update, and deletion.

## Testing

### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

API endpoint testing was accomplished with the aid of Postman. POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods were tested by serving the database on the backend, and connecting to it via API endpoint URLs. Some of the test required admin access, so authentication was required prior to gaining access to those endpoints. 

## Reflection

### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course was an introductory overview of fullstack development. It has opened my perspective to a whole new set of skills that are required to create and maintain a web application. Among those, JavaScript, Angular, React, Node.js, and Express seem to be leaders in the industry and I will definitely benefit from becoming familiar in this course.
